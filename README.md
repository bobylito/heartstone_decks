# Bobylito's Hearthstone decks

Hey there, this repo contains the archive and my current Hearthstone deck.

This is a way for me to keep track of the changes I make on them. And also
you can try them (no legend material here though ;))

To use: 

 - open hearthstone
 - open "my collection"
 - copy the content of the deck file into your clipboard
 - HearthStone will ask if you want to create a deck from the content of the clipboard: say yes
 - Here you are :)

To do the same in your own repo:

 - open a deck in Hearthstone
 - move your mouse over the title
 - click "copy"
 - paste the content in a file

Happy games :)
